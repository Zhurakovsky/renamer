Simple tool for copying files from multiple local network sources to one folder on the local computer.
Information about files, which should be copied stored in the .csv file.
Structure of .csv file:
obj_id; path_to_source_file; path_to_destination_file;

So, all we need - to create the new structure of folders inside the target folder on "C:/", copy file to the new destination
and write target file path to new txt file.
